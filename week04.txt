-Conflict
Occurs when the remote modification is different from the local modification

Solution
Combine both or remove one of them
Combine both-> merge

-git command
log --oneline
log --oneline --graph

J to go up in the editor, K to go down, Q to exit


oneline command -> If the commit is long, only the hash code and commit message are briefly displayed.

conflict review

Remove one of the two -> Remove the desired part from the conflicted part either remotely or locally

-In case of automatic merge (if the files are not of the same series)
After modifying README.md remotely and committing, and modifying week04.txt locally and committing, 
if you try to push, the same rejected conflict occurs, and then you do git pull, in all cases, 
the auto merge failure error does not appear and it is possible right away.
